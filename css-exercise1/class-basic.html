      <span class="special underline">Edouard Baldus is a French landscape, architecture and railway photographer.</span> Many of his missions are documentary in nature.He 1856 off on a brief mission to film the damage caused by heavy rains and river flooding in Lyon, Avignon and Tarascon. He made a moving record of floods. He often retouched his negatives to remove buildings and trees, or put clouds in a white sky, and in his medieval engraving of the monastery of St.Trofim in Arles, he pieced together 10 different negatives to get in-depth focus on the panorama of the interior space and render the details in the brightly lit courtyard outside. I learned some techniques from his photographic experience and works, such as recording certain objects. On the subject of daydreaming, I think of the content of daydreaming, is the world of flowers, grass, trees, blue sky and white clouds, some of the natural things, they are very beautiful and pure. So I took pictures of the sky, some of which had post-processing. Do some Photoshop on the photo, like adding clouds to the sky through Photoshop.
